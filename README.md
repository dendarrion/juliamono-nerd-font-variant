This is a the beautiful [JuliaMono](https://github.com/cormullion/juliamono) font by Cormullion extended via fontforge (aka [Nerd Fonts Patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher)) with all single width glyphs from the Nerd Fonts project.

## Feel free to fork and modify!

Just fork and adjust the fontforge settings in .github/workflows/patch-font.yml, then run the action! (If you patch all glyphs it runs approximately 20 - 30 min)
